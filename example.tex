\section{Introduction}
This is a citation \citep{A01}. Or use the full features of natbib to cite \citet{B02}.
Use CleverRef to reference figures like \cref{fig:example-figure} or \cref{fig:example-figure-2col}.
It also works with tables, like so (\cref{tbl:example-table}) and equations, referenced as \cref{eqn:example-equation}.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:example-equation}
    e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation}
