Custom Latex class I use for my preprints based off the ``extarticle`` class.

Looks like a modern journal publication There are several options such as:

- single/two column layout, with optimized two-column figures
- specifying the article type (Article, Communication, Review, Perspective)
- adding a TOC figure next to the abstract
- hyperlinked ORCID
- authors designated as "equal contribution"
- line numbering for reviewers
- a "Supplemental Information" switch for SI generation

Check [``example.tex``](example.tex) for a minimal document and
[``example.pdf``](example.pdf) for how it will (likely) compile.

Use at your own risk.
